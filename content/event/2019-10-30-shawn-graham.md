**An XLab Brown Bag with Shawn Graham, Department of History: Making Sense of Networks**

**November 27, 11.30**

**History Department Lounge, 4th Floor Paterson Hall**

Join us for the last XLab Brown Bag of the Fall 2019 term, for an introduction to network analysis. Shawn will go over how to make sense of networks that might exist in the materials you are studying: how to draw them out, how to analyze, and how to visualize them. And also, he'll discuss _when not to use_ networks. We'll work through [this tutorial from the Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/exploring-and-analyzing-network-data-with-python) together: no one ever said you had to do everything by yourself!
